    "Imagine it's your first day at an exciting new job at a fast-growing tech company, Innovatech. You're filled with a mix of anticipation and nerves, eager to make a great first impression and contribute to your team. As you find your way to your desk, decorated with a welcoming note and some company swag, you can't help but feel a surge of pride. This is the moment you've been working towards, and it's finally here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your manager, Alex, greets you with a warm smile. \"Welcome aboard! We're thrilled to have you with us. I have sent you a folder. Inside this folder, you'll find everything you need to get up to speed on our company policies, culture, and the projects your team is working on. Please keep them private.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You thank Alex and open the folder, only to be greeted by a mountain of documents - manuals, guidelines, technical documents, project summaries, and more. It's overwhelming. You think to yourself, \"How am I supposed to absorb all of this information in a short time? And they are private and I cannot just upload it to GPT to summarize them.\" \"Why not create an agent to read and summarize them for you, and then you can just ask it?\" your colleague, Jordan, suggests with an encouraging grin. You're intrigued, but uncertain; the world of large language models (LLMs) is one that you've only scratched the surface of. Sensing your hesitation, Jordan elaborates, \"Imagine having a personal assistant who's not only exceptionally fast at reading but can also understand and condense the information into easy-to-digest summaries. That's what an LLM can do for you, especially when enhanced with LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"But how do I get started? And how long will it take to set up something like that?\" you ask. Jordan says, \"Let's dive into a project that will not only help you tackle this immediate challenge but also equip you with a skill set that's becoming indispensable in this field.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---------\n",

    "So, this project steps you through the fascinating world of LLMs and RAG, starting from the basics of what these technologies are, to building a practical application that can read and summarize documents for you. By the end of this tutorial, you have a working tool capable of processing the pile of documents on your desk, allowing you to focus on making meaningful contributions to your projects sooner.\n"

    "\n",
    "### What is RAG?\n",
    "One of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data, which can be your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to public data up to the specific point in time that they were trained. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model’s cut-off date, you must augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information that it needs. The process of bringing and inserting the appropriate information into the model prompt is known as RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain has several components that are designed to help build Q&A applications and RAG applications, more generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG architecture\n",
    "A typical RAG application has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Indexing**: A pipeline for ingesting and indexing data from a source. This usually happens offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval and generation**: The actual RAG chain takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like the following examples.\n"

    "1. Load: First, you must load your data. This is done with [DocumentLoaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#document-loaders).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Split: [Text splitters](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#text-splitters) break large `Documents` into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it into a model because large chunks are harder to search and won’t fit in a model’s finite context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Store: You need somewhere to store and index your splits so that they can later be searched. This is often done using a [VectorStore](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#vector-stores) and [Embeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/embed_text/) model.\n",
